* Can you make a `Sprite`?
* Can you make the `Sprite` actually get drawn/rendered?
* Can you make the `Sprite` move?
* Can you make the `Sprite` move in response to user input?
* Can you modify `update()` so that Sprites can't leave 
 the screen.
* Can you randomly place lettuce Sprites around the
    screen?
* Can you complete the Sprite class so that `getBoundary()` and `intersects(Sprite)` work properly? Then can you use your fixes to make it so that lettuce Sprites disappear when the turtle Sprite "hits" them (aka intersects them)?
