## Class
* [AnimationIntro](https://replit.com/team/APCSA-Block5-2122/AnimationIntro)
    - open up src/main/java/replit/Main.java
    - see if you can figure out what the heck is going on
    - can you make different things happen?
    - Can you make the ball move?
    - Can you make the ball bounce?
    - Can you make a bunch of balls? (For a start don't try to make balls bounce off each other)
    - Can you make other shapes that move?
    - Can you make the balls' radii change over time?
